# RunTracker
This repository contains MATLAB code to build a run tracker from data collected on your phone sensors.  
# Background story
We use MATLAB Mobile to collect acceleration and position data from an Androidâ„¢ or iOS mobile device and use it to build a run/walk tracker.
# Goals
We use the sensor data to count the number of steps taken and map the course taken.
1. Import data
2. Interactively visualize and explore trends
3. Process raw data to count steps 
4. Create a web map of the course
5. Document results
